This post was primarily written to review new C+11 with the Mantid team but contains no Mantid-specific code. It was adapted from [these slides](https://isocpp.org/blog/2012/12/c11-a-cheat-sheet-alex-sinyakov) by Alex Sinyakov.

C++11 will feel like a new language in many aspects. New language features include:

* `auto`
* `nullptr` constant
* raw string literals
* range-based for loops
* lambdas
* initializer lists for POD structs
* delegating constructors
* r-value references and move constructors

New standard library features include:

* smart pointers - `shared_ptr`, `unique_ptr`, `scoped_ptr`
* tuple
* initializer lists for containers

auto
----

auto takes the place of a hand-written type and forces the compiler to fill in the details:

```c++
std::vector<int> indexes(1);
auto n = indexes.size();
```
