This post was primarily written to review new C+11 with the Mantid team but contains no Mantid-specific code.

C++11 will feel like a new language in many aspects. New features include:

* `auto`
* r-value references and move constructors
* lambdas
* range-based for loops
* initializer lists for containers and POD structs
* tuple
* smart pointers - `shared_ptr`, `unique_ptr`, `scoped_ptr`

auto
----

auto takes the place of a hand-written type and forces the compiler to fill in the details:

```c++
std::vector<int> indexes(1);
auto n = indexes.size();
```
